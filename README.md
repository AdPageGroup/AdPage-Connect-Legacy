## Get started
So you've made some awesome campaigns and you can't wait to publish them on your own website?
When you have an WordPress-website, you can simple use our plugin and save yourself from headaches. With this plugin, you don't need an separated domain names with annoying DNS-settings.

Install the plugin by searching "AdPage" in WordPress' plugin directory, or by uploading the ZIP.
Go to your [dashboard](https://app.adpage.io/dashboard/settings) an create an API-key, it'll look like this: `V1.jordi.1517841832.d657948gadf72a0e95e94`

When you created an key, click the "view"-button and an popup will open with the generated key. Copy & paste this into the box that you'll see on the plugin page. If the key matches, you'll see an list of all your campaigns.

In order to publish campaigns on your own website, an [premium subscription](https://app.adpage.io/dashboard/subscription) is required.

## Important!
To make sure your campaigns are running fast and smoothly on your website, the plugin caches an version locally. An cache file will be created when the campaign URL is requested for the first time. After that, the local version will be served.

Once you make changes to the campaign on AdPage, you need to clear your cache, else the local version keeps being shown to your visitors.
